# Workflows Index

This repository uses the Enhanced AI Agent OS workflows as the canonical set of runnable agent definitions.

- Primary workflows: `enhanced-ai-agent-os/workflows/`
- Tool-specific examples in this folder are documentation-only. Runnable JSONs live under the Enhanced tree.

If you are looking for concrete agent workflows (e.g., `analysis-agent.json`, `research-agent.json`, `master-orchestration-agent.json`), go to:

```
enhanced-ai-agent-os/workflows/
```

The previous `sample-workflow.json` templates in `workflows/*/` have been backed up to a timestamped folder under `backup/` as part of repository cleanup.
