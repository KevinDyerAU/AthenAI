Solution: Use the Python manager's configuration system to specify alternative port ranges or manually configure specific ports for dedicated use.

**Dependency Issues**:
Node.js and npm version conflicts can cause installation and runtime issues.

Solution: Use Node Version Manager (nvm) to ensure consistent Node.js versions across deployments, and clear npm cache if package installation fails.

**Performance Issues**:
Large file uploads or extensive knowledge bases may impact performance.

Solution: Implement file size limits, enable compression, and consider implementing pagination for large datasets.

**Browser Compatibility**:
Older browsers may not support all interface features.

Solution: The interface is designed for modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+) with graceful degradation for older versions.

### Logging and Diagnostics

**Log Locations**:
- Application logs: `chat-ui.log` in the deployment directory
- Manager logs: `chat-ui-manager.log` for Python manager operations
- Browser console: Client-side errors and debugging information
- Network logs: Browser developer tools for API communication

**Diagnostic Commands**:
```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f chat-ui.log

# Check process status
ps aux | grep vite

# Test port availability
nc -z localhost 5173

# Validate configuration
python3 chat-ui-manager.py config
```
