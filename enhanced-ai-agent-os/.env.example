# Pointer: Environment Configuration
# This project now uses the unified environment example at the repository root.
# Please configure environment variables using:
#
#   ../.env.example
#
# You can copy that file to your local .env (or environment-specific variants)
# and adjust values as needed. Do NOT commit real secrets.
