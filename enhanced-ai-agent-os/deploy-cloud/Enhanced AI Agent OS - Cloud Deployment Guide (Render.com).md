## Pre-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.cloud` file with your credentials:

```bash
# Render.com Configuration
RENDER_API_KEY=your_render_api_key_here
RENDER_OWNER_ID=your_render_owner_id_here

# GitHub Configuration
GITHUB_REPO_URL=https://github.com/KevinDyerAU/NeoV3
GITHUB_BRANCH=main

# Neo4j AuraDB Configuration
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password_here

# CloudAMQP Configuration (Optional)
CLOUDAMQP_URL=amqps://user:pass@host:port/vhost

# AI Service Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Grafana Cloud Configuration (Optional)
GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_grafana_api_key_here
GRAFANA_CLOUD_URL=https://your-stack.grafana.net
PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL=https://prometheus-prod-01-eu-west-0.grafana.net/api/prom/push
```

### 2. Service Sizing Configuration

Configure service resources based on your needs:

```yaml
# configs/render/sizing.yaml
services:
  n8n_web:
    plan: "starter"  # starter, standard, pro
    region: "oregon" # oregon, frankfurt, singapore
    auto_deploy: true
    
  ai_worker:
    plan: "standard"
    region: "oregon"
    instances: 2
    
  database:
    plan: "starter"  # starter, standard, pro
    region: "oregon"
    version: "15"
```

## Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The automated deployment script handles the complete cloud deployment:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-cloud.sh

# Run cloud deployment
./deploy-cloud.sh
```

The script will:
1. Validate all credentials and prerequisites
2. Create Render.com services with optimal configurations
3. Set up managed databases and external services
4. Configure monitoring and security
5. Deploy AI agent workflows
6. Verify deployment health and connectivity
7. Display access information and management URLs

### Post-Deploy Migrations (Managed Databases)

After the upstream deployment completes, the root-level `deploy-cloud.sh` automatically applies the unified schemas to your managed databases.

- PostgreSQL schema: `db/postgres/schema.sql`
- Neo4j schema: `db/neo4j/schema.cypher`

The scripts used are:

```bash
# Runs automatically from deploy-cloud.sh after upstream deploy
scripts/migrations/cloud-apply-postgres.sh
scripts/migrations/cloud-apply-neo4j.sh
```

These scripts read `.env.cloud` for the following keys:

- PostgreSQL: `DATABASE_URL` (preferred) or `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE` (or `POSTGRES_*` equivalents)
- Neo4j: `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`

#### Render Post-Deploy Command (optional)

If you want Render to run migrations automatically on each deploy of your app service, configure the “Post-deploy command” as:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Ensure repo scripts are available in the Render container; adjust path if needed
./scripts/migrations/cloud-apply-postgres.sh
./scripts/migrations/cloud-apply-neo4j.sh
```

Render will inject service environment variables, so `.env.cloud` is not required inside the container if variables are defined in the service settings.

### Manual Deployment (Advanced Users)

For advanced users who prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Validate credentials
./scripts/validate-credentials.sh

# 2. Create core services
./scripts/create-services.sh

# 3. Configure monitoring
./scripts/configure-monitoring.sh

# 4. Deploy workflows
./scripts/deploy-workflows.sh

# 5. Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```
